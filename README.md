# VitaLab

VitaLab is an innovative application designed to streamline laboratory management. With VitaLab, doctors can schedule tests for a variety of diseases and set deadlines for test completion. Once the results are ready, the system automatically notifies both the doctor and the patient. The patient receives a direct link to access the report with the results, ensuring that the information is visible only to the specific doctor and patient.

Additionally, the application allows patients to schedule appointments, which doctors can accept or decline as needed. VitaLab provides an efficient and secure experience for managing tests and appointments, facilitating communication and access to results.
